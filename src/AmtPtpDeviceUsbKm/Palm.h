// Palm.h - Palm classification.
//
// Extracted verbatim (scoring logic unchanged) from the old
// AmtClassifyPalm in Match.c. Per-sample classification only; this
// file makes no session-level decisions (PalmDetected latch, whole-pad
// blank persistence) - that orchestration stays where the rest of the
// per-frame session state lives, since it is symmetrical with
// GestureThisFrame (see Match.c/Interrupt.c/PTPCore.c). This file answers
// exactly one question per finger: "does this single sample look like
// a palm", nothing more - consistent with Phase 6 of the task spec
// ("ONLY: suppress reporting; DO NOT affect identity/FSM/tracking").
