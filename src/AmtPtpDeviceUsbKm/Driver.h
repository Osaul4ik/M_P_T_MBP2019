// happens on every sleep/wake where the parent hub momentarily drops the

// of the driver means a GUI handle left open across such a cycle keeps
// the old control device (and its name) alive past the point where the
// next FDO instance tries to create a new one under the same name -
// WdfDeviceInitAssignName then fails with STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_COLLISION,
// which fails that FDO's entire EvtDeviceAdd and leaves the touchpad
// completely non-functional until something else clears the name (e.g.
// the GUI process exiting). Creating the control device once per driver
